This is a program that concurrently counts the number of palindromes in a dictionary

Running make compiles palindrome.c, and the output name is palindrome
The file compiles with gcc 4.9.

Running the shellscript speedup.sh prints a table with speedup for different number of threads and different dictionary sizes.
An example of print out can be found in the file speedup_output_example.
*The script runs palindrome 5 times sequentially and takes the median execution time of the parallel section. This is repeated for each new size.
*The script then runs palindrome 5 times for each combination of sizes and number of threads and takes the median value.
*The speedup is then calculated as SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION TIME / PARALLEL EXECUTION TIME

The list of sizes and number of threads can be changed in speedup.sh.
